          The purpose of an online catalog for a school is to provide students,
          parents, faculty, and staff with a comprehensive and easily accessible
          source of information about the courses, programs, and services
          offered by the school. In addition, an online catalog can be a
          valuable tool for prospective students and their families who are
          researching schools. It can provide detailed information about the
          school's history, mission, and values, as well as its academic
          programs and services. Overall, an online catalog can help promote
          transparency, accessibility, and communication within a school
          community by providing a centralized and up-to-date source of
          information about the school's academic offerings and policies.
